# Mob-ESP-Datapack-1.19
A mob ESP datapack for 1.19, works both for singleplayer and servers

This datapack, with the use of 2 commands, will highlight every single mob (even bosses and player) and separate them between
hostile (red), neutral (yellow), passive (green), boss (pink) and player (purple) by default

You can always change the color of the categories by using /team modify (team) color (color you'd like to use for each category), remind yourself only that 
using the "/function:rc" after changing the color of a category WILL change the color of all categories by default

To start the ESP, you need first to use "/function mobesp:rc" to set a list of categories for the mobs

You'll notice that the ESP won't start working, as it has a switch

To use it, do "/trigger Switch", using this will alternate between on and off

I hope this datapack is usefull for whatever purpose you have

You can suggest some new utility that fits into the theme of the pack or report bugs in Issues if you'd like

To instal the datapack, download the .zip in Releases and put it on the "datapacks" folder , it should work just fine

This datapack was made for 1.19, but if you want to use it in previous versions, change the pack.mcmeta file in the line {"pack_format":10} to 
the correspondent number of the version you'd like to play, check the wiki if you don't know how this number works

Also, if you change the pack to any version before 1.16 none Pigmans will have the effect as they aren't listed
